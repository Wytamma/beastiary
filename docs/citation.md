%X Bayesian phylogenetics has gained substantial popularity in the last decade, with most implementations relying on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The computational demands of MCMC mean that remote servers are increasingly used. We present Beastiary, a package for real-time and remote inspection of log files generated by MCMC analyses. Beastiary is an easily deployed web-app that can be used to summarise and visualise the output of many popular software packages including BEAST, BEAST2, RevBayes, and MrBayes via a web browser.
